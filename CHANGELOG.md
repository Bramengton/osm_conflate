# OSM Conflator Change Log

## master branch

* Use `-v` for debug messages and `-q` to suppress informational messages.
* You can run `conflate/conflate.py` as a script, again.
# Profiles: added "override" dict with dataset id â†’ OSM POI name or id like 'n12345'.
* Profiles: added "matched" function that returns `False` if an OSM point should not be matched to dataset point (fixes [#6](https://github.com/mapsme/osm_conflate/issues/6)).
* Profiles: `master_tags` is no longer mandatory.
* If no `master_tags` specified in a profile, all tags are now considered non-master.
